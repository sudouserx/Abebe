# Abebe: A Flutter Package for Typing Speed Based Animation Control

Abebe is a Flutter package that adjusts the speed of an animation based on the user's typing speed. It uses the `Lottie` animation and modifies the animation's playback speed in real-time as characters are typed into a text field.

## Features

- Controls the speed of Lottie animations based on typing speed.
- Customizable animation speed multiplier.
- Supports dynamic and real-time animation updates.

## Installation

To use the `Abebe` package in your Flutter project, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  abebe: ^1.0.0

## Getting started

Then, run the following command to install the package:

flutter pub get


## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Abebe package:

Import the package:

import 'package:abebe/abebe.dart';

Create a TextEditingController:

TextEditingController _controller = TextEditingController();

Use the Abebe widget:

Abebe(
  assetPath: 'assets/your_lottie_animation.json', // Path to your Lottie asset
  textController: _controller,
  speedMultiplier: 2, // Optional multiplier to adjust speed
)

Wrap it with a UI component:

    Scaffold(
      body: Column(
        children: [
          TextField(
            controller: _controller,
            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Start typing...',
            ),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: Abebe(
              assetPath: 'assets/animation.json',
              textController: _controller,
              speedMultiplier: 1,
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );

Parameters

    assetPath (required): The path to the Lottie asset you want to display.
    textController (required): The TextEditingController linked to the text field.
    speedMultiplier (optional): A multiplier to adjust the speed of the animation. Default is 1.
