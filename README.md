Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Abebe package:

3. Use the Abebe widget:

    ```dart
    Abebe(
      assetPath: 'assets/your_lottie_animation.json', // Path to your Lottie asset
      textController: _controller,
      speedMultiplier: 2, // Optional multiplier to adjust speed
    )
    ```

4. Wrap it with a UI component:

    ```dart
    Scaffold(
      body: Column(
        children: [

            decoration: InputDecoration(
              labelText: 'Start typing...',
            ),
          ),
          Expanded(
            child: Abebe(
              assetPath: 'assets/animation.json',
              textController: _controller,
              speedMultiplier: 1,
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
    ```

## Parameters
